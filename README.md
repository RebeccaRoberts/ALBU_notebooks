# ALBU_notebooks

These are some of the notebooks that I have used as part of my PhD studies. They can be used as supporting documentation for my appendices as follows:

### Appendix A
polya_appendix_A.ipynb -- a notebook showing a simple 3 node graphical model, which is similar to one branch of the word-topic side of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

hierachical_sampling_for_dirichlet_polya_Appendix_A.ipynb -- the hirachical sampling to process to calculate the local message from a Polya to a Dirichlet distribution (described in Section A.1.4.2) is shown for the 3D and 2D case

dirichlet_approximation_Appendix_A.ipynb -- the approximation from the Polya to the Dirichlet distribution is described and plotted for the 2D case
